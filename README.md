Project Title: Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the next day's stock price using historical data

# Algorithm used
- Linear Regression

# Tools and libraries 
- Python (Tool)
- NumPy (Library)
- Scikit-learn (Library)

# How it works 
Previous day's price is used to predict the next day's price.

# Output
The model predicts future stock prices based on learned trends.

## Future Scope
- Add multiple features
- Use LSTM for better accuracy
